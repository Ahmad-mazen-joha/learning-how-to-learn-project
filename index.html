          In the scope of planning and organizing tasks , I have learned the (GTD) and it is a way of dividing tasks and I highly recommend you to use it.<br> <br> <span style="color: var(--beag); padding-left: 120px;"> this was my experiences tell me yours.</span></p>

      This is one of the most important learning strategies, Our brain can focus for 25 minutes!! Studies and experiments have proven the success of this technique, All you have to do is set your alarm for 25 minutes, then start working. When the alarm rings, you will have 5 minutes to rest before you repeat this simple process and get back to work. One of the most important things when using this process is to try as much as possible to have an environment without distractions. A nearby library or a quiet garden will be an excellent option. in the end, After you spend 25 minutes of focused work, reward yourself with something you like, such as a cup of coffee or a delicious piece of chocolate.

     <h1>procrastination</h1>
    
     <p>Procrastination is one of the biggest obstacles to our progress and success in many fields. It usually happens when your lazy brain does not want to do this difficult task, so it starts broadcasting various excuses in your head and creates a lot of pain to avoid you from doing your task. The strange thing is that once you start the task, all the illusions and pains disappear suddenly. From here we conclude that the hardest part is the starting part, and when you skip the beginning and start working, things will be easier and simpler

      For me, one of the most important ways to eliminate procrastination was what I learned from Ms. Barbar Oakly. (Focus on the work, not the result),and this was the most important step in eliminating procrastination.Also,the Pomodoro method that I mentioned earlier had a great impact.</p>

        <p>That was all. I hope you have benefited from my humble web page. Of course, there are still many other methods that was explained in the course, such as spaced repetition, chunk, memory palaces, how to create habits, and the importance of both sleep and sports, etc... But I was satisfied with what I saw, the most important of what was mentioned. Again, I thank m.barbara oakley, and I strongly advise you to read her book Mind for Numbers, and thank you for your time. I hope you like this site.</p>
